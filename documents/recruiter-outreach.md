# Recruiter Outreach

Now that you have your list of LinkedIn Profile URLs, you can use Phantombuster to automate messaging your list of Profile URLs you've created.

## Copy URL List to Google Sheets

PhantomBuster needs your list, so you can upload the CSV to Google Drive, or you can copy that list to Google Sheets.

Create a **Shareable Google Sheet**, so that _anyone who has the link_ can access the data.

Then paste your `linkedin_urls.csv` data into your Google Sheet.

This is my [Google Sheet for Recruiter Outreach](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CZJlUC3f1IVK4kHPLjWFSPrdeS5uW46tMn7tjor1YFo/edit?usp=sharing)

## Setup Messaging Campaign in PhantomBuster
