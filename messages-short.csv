You offered some great perspective when I needed it. And I believe that I was never actually onboarded to either team that I was working with.  A year and a half after joining Bill, for one of my tickets I was setting up Tank, the GraphQL repo for the first time. Which didn't make sense. That should have been part of setting up local repos.  When I realized that I was never actually onboarded, I had a meeting with my manager this past Monday with a plan to address this. For my upcoming quarterly goal, I was going to work with the tech lead to write the onboarding documentation myself. Then the lead would only have to provide their time to work with me.  So now that this happened, and I got laid off, I'm going to write a generic onboarding guide for new engineers. Since I feel that most of the online learning surrounding Engineering is focused on learning practical skills like coding, and then practicing for the interview process. But it ends there. So I'm planning on filling that gap myself. Firstly for me, but then maybe I can turn this into something that adds value for others.",INBOX

I think this is something you should review with your candidates moving forward. There are some serious privacy concerns here.  Also this test didn't actually test my knowledge of working with React, since I was not able to use the tools I normally would in engineering. I rely on these tools to navigate the code base, and then test the data coming in from the backend to render the data on the frontend.   Where was the data coming from for the todo list? How was I supposed to find that? Was I expected to navigate the file structure of the server to find the data?  I'm not sure what this test was supposed to uncover about my ability to engineer, but I didn't move forward with this test. Also, you should consider a coding platform that supports ES6 Javascript standards, since that's what most engineers use now.",INBOX

This looks amazing! I’ll definitely apply today. I have a really unique background since I started my carrer in Quality Assurance in video games for Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta for GameTap and Adult Swim with their Web and iOS games.   Then I came to the Bay and worked in Video Games for a while as a Quality Assurance Engineer. Then when games went free to play, I worked on the monetization platforms designing the Playable Ads for free to play games. That’s where I picked up UI/UX design with Sketch & Figma.

Now I see that you are on a team with William-Sonoma, but I would love to find a few moments on your calendar to dive into your background together a little more in depth, and also share with you more of this opportunity we are building out over here at AIM. Even if you're not looking, what better time than now to network for your future in this ever-changing market.   Do you have a few minutes to spare in your day today or later this week to connect?

We were introduced to them from some executives at eBay whom we have known for many years.  MarketNation came into existence in 2019 to help Brands and their Distribution Partners verticalize their operations by making sales direct-to-consumer easy and everywhere.  Basically, putting the power back into the hands of companies directly in terms of connecting them to consumers directly versus using Amazon as an example.  The product focus has a real anti amazon vibe in some sense, but in a positive/needed way industry wise.  They have 6 high level investors from Walmart already prepared for their series A.  Their team/board is made up of ex Amazon, eBay and Walmart eCommerce leaders with 100+ years of marketplace expertise.  I got vibe they are on to something substantial to say the least.  They have been using an dev agency in the East Coast, but now gearing up to build an in-house team.  They are in need of a Sr Software Engineer ideally with some e-commerce experience mixed with Vuejs and Nodejs.  Their CTO was a key Architect from PayPal for 6+ years and he is the one you would work closely with as they scale.  Given they are pre series A they are hoping to find someone part time (5-10k per month) until they raise their series A in March/April.  If the right person willing to join now and make a contribution they would offer a substantial equity stake that could likely amount to something life changing.  If interested send me a resume and lets chat.  I'd love to give you more context on this startup.  Have a great weekend.  Cheers.  Mitchell Corsini Head of Talent",INBOX

This is a huge opportunity to be in on the ground floor of a cutting-edge tech startup that is just going to grow and grow, CEO Alex Miller, previously of Stack Overflow, says this potential combination of lower fees than ethereum but greater security on the settlement layer of the transactions courtesy of bitcoin's chain is the enticing proposition being put forward by Stacks and Hiro.

My job is great, but the situaion here in Macedonia is getting bad in regards to homophobia so I really wanna move out. I started applying to positions in the Netherlands, Germany and Denmark, and I sent an application to Appier.

I worked on a Wordpress react site for a non profit, with a few other engineers. This had me working with a team, and our work had to be approved by the client.  I put it on my resume as freelance work, and that helped out a ton.   As far as your portfolio, I took some Udemy React courses, then custom styled the projects & added those to my portfolio.  Creating a consistent custom style across your projects is a good way to show you put the work in to create them yourself. ",INBOX

(React/JS/Python),"Hi Jason!  My name is Aaron and I work at Robin Games, a women-led mobile gaming startup creating lifestyle experiences! We’ve raised $21M in funding, we're a fully remote company, and we’re just a few months out from launching our first game, an interior design app where players live the life of a professional interior designer (think Instagram and Pinterest meets mobile gaming!).  I’m reaching out as we're hiring a Senior Full Stack Engineer who loves developing frontend tools and applications in React, JavaScript, and Python, and who's excited to work with a variety of new tools and technologies. You’d be partnering with our internal teams to develop tools and content, write gameplay logic, manage our analytics pipeline, and program backend APIs. It's a little bit of everything, and looking at your background, I think you'd really thrive here!  Here's a link to the job description: https://robingames.com/senior-full-stack-engineer  If you love games, enjoy working in a diverse, culture-first startup environment, and want to lead and own the development efforts across a variety of projects, this is the role for you!  We’re still in the stealth phase of our company so there’s not a ton you can read about us online, but you can get a glimpse from this TechCrunch interview we did last year: https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/female-led-robin-games-raises-7-million-to-combine-lifestyle-content-with-fantasy-gaming/  Would you have time this week for an intro call? I’d love to chat with you more about the role, your experiences, and the fabulous team we have over here :)  Looking forward to hearing from you!

Specifically, because our team at ShipBob is looking for a Senior Frontend Engineer to join our growing engineering team.      We recently acquired our Series E funding at $200 million.  And our total valuation just surpassed the billion dollar mark, making us Chicago's newest tech unicorn.  We are #1 on Crain's 2020 “Fast 50” list of the fastest-growing companies in Chicago & Inc. 5000 top 500 companies with the most proven track records. And we just crossed the $1 billion valuation mark.  With this growth, we are looking for top talent to help us reach the next level.  We're just about as cutting-edge of a .NET shop as they come.  But in this case we're looking for a UI developer with solid JavaScript chops, ideally with Vue.js experience.  But specific framework experience is less important than solid UI principals to us.    Yes, we're a remote first organization, so you can basically work from anywhere in the USA.  But if you'd really like to, you can work in our office in the West Loop of Chicago.  Totally up to you.    I'd love to chat with you about the details of the role and our company and to see if what we're looking for lines up with your career goals.

It’s a good amount of React and JavaScript tooling and application development, along with a couple other things depending on what you’re interested in (we’re pretty flexible). https://robingames.com/senior-full-stack-engineer  And here’s a little bit about our company (we’re in our stealth phase, so there’s not a ton out there about us yet): https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/19/female-led-robin-games-raises-7-million-to-combine-lifestyle-content-with-fantasy-gaming/  If you’re interested, give me a holler! I’d love to chat. If you’re not interested, you are now legally bound to send this opportunity to at least one friend. Failure to comply will result in me losing my sanity (hiring engineers is a bit challenging -- you guys are quite popular).  Talk soon!  Aaron Sullivan Recruiting & Operations @ Robin Games",INBOX

This role will report to our Head of Engineering and work cross-functionally with other company leaders to ensure there is a significant input in bringing our product vision to life.  We are on the journey of enriching the customer experience, unlike the other countless ""deep discount"" ecommerce websites, we take a different approach to helping wineries move inventory.  Rather than providing value to our members through discounts, value is provided through randomized upgrades to more premium wines. Not only does this provide an exciting new way for wine consumers to experience high-end wines they might not otherwise go to the store and buy, but it allows a winery to maintain its price point by never advertising their product at a discount. Discounts ruin brands - We preserve them.  I’d love to get a call scheduled to talk more about the role.

Companies will reach out blind via Wanted only based on locations, skills & min. salary. That is when you (as a talent) will know about the company. You will get a page with all the details (committed salary of course but also perks, equity, project, team etc…) Then, only if you accept to reveal your profile, they will know more about you (like who you are). If you don’t like the offer, your profile keeps being anonymous. This way, we keep everyone anonymous until there is a salary+skill match, and the talent accepts the company request. Does it make sense? That is why we will need to know your salary request first (can be something like your current + 15-25%) to check if there is a match etc. Keep in mind that companies working with us pay +30% over the market because we don’t take any placement fees.  Let me know your thoughts, and if you want me to sign you up! (The whole process is free).  Best,  Alaric",INBOX

It was the first thing I built at General Assembly.   As far as skilling-up, I've had some experience in the past with mobile automation testing and writing test scripts in Python & Javascript, but I hadn't worked on engineering features in any of my roles at Kixeye & Chartboost.   I've been casually studying engineering for the past few years, but never seemed to build the momentum to have anything to show for it. So after a layoff in October, I decided it was time to go all-in, and attend a software engineering bootcamp. I've been wanting to enroll for years, but it's not possible if you're working a full-time job. So I jumped at the chance.   Having a background in design and some engineering helped, for sure. I storyboarded my apps, and made mockups in Sketch, which I used to build my apps. It was a transformative experience and I'm glad that I went for it.  I don't do game jams now, since I'm trying to get work on the frontend with React, so I've been building React projects in school, and after.   If you'd like to check out my storyboard for Crush It!!!, I have it in my github repo here as a PDF.  https://github.com/JasonToups/CrushIt-BlockCrusherGame/blob/master/design/CrushIt-Storyboard.pdf  If you ever want to connect about anything, feel free to reach out. I'd be more than happy to share my experience.   Cheers, -Jason",INBOX

The game looks terrific - very interactive. I will need some practice to get good at it :)  I am really interested in your experience - adult swim, kixeye, others? It sounds like you were really involved. May I ask why you wanted to skill up further with the GA bootcamp?  I was lucky to pick up a design job with the client from our class project, and am in the first week there - already designing an interactive onboarding. The app really needs to get that piece right, and it's just not there currently.   Do you ever do game jams? Are you still working on games or pivoting to something else?  Cheers!",INBOX

Could you please send me the test again? I blocked out time this weekend to work on it, and I would like to work on it today. While I did login yesterday to begin working on the test, I had to put it down for the day after working through a few questions. I want to finish up the test. I did run into some difficulty with some of the questions where the differences between Python 2.x and 3.x were emphasized.   To get a clearer understanding of my skills, what I would like to do is as follows: Take the test, and if there are any questions that I do not understand, make a note of those concepts or methods, but do not answer those questions. I don't want to leave the chance of getting a right answer, when I am not 100% sure of the solution. I believe this would be a more fair assessment of my current skills.   Then write up my own skills assessment from the test, noting which areas I believe I did well in, and then detail areas of improvement. Follow that up with action items to work towards developing those skills, including taking a Python course for school to fulfill my Science requirement for my degree. I have to run that past my professor, but considering that I'm focusing on writing my Philosophy papers about the intersection of Philosophy and Software Development, I believe he will approve the coursework. When I'm done with the test, I will submit the test and my written postmortem along with it.   When you get a chance, let me know if or when I can take the assessment.   Also, I attached my Philosophy Term Paper about Agile Methodologies and Adam Smith's Theories of Moral Sentiments, if you are interested in reading about my approach to sympathy in working with a team, and ensuring working code and software.

She educated me that maybe you're looking at taxes for an Independent contractor, which ARE higher.  As an Independent contractor you do pay higher taxes for yourself and are not entitled to benefits from us. However, when you work with us, you work on W2, as a Consultant employee on our payroll and your taxes remain the same as what you're currently paying.  (Any taxes you pay with us will be dependent on what you declare on your W4)  You can also discuss and confirm this with our CEO when you interview with him.  You are free to withdraw at any point if you think that we are not offering you a good deal, that is you prerogative.  Our aim is to establish a long working relationship and that will happen only if you're happy working with us.   If you're comfortable proceeding with $40/hr W2 with Health insurance and 15 days PTO (equivalent to $80k/year), let me know so we can discuss next steps. There's also the potential of converting to Full time with Oculus and the salary you negotiate will be between you and Oculus .   I know you're occupied with term exams this week, so all you'd need to do is send a confirmation to proceed and you can take the test over the weekend.    PS: My Payroll Manager, Ilisa, is open to talking to you and I can arrange that call if you're still not sure.  Awaiting your response!  Regards, Ruchika",INBOX

And thanks for reaching out beforehand as well :)   If you're interested in front-end positions, I would definitely recommend hosting your own portfolio site using GitHub pages. It can be super simple, but that is another great way to show off some front-end skills for sure! Squarespace is also a nice skill to have, including if you are doing any custom work but if you're looking for a more traditional front-end role I think taking the extra time to build your own site is worth it.

And I'm happy to welcome you to the group!   It's my responsibility to make this a top resource for React Developers!  Please carefully read the following information:  My email is brian@angularjobs.com. Please send me a message and let me know what you need to grow in your career with React. Or just say ""hi"" and let me know you're happy to be a part of the group 😄  I'm looking forward to hearing from you.  When I started contributing to the JavaScript Community, React was just an idea. And now it's an important part of the tech stack. And thousands of businesses are using it worldwide!  In this group, we discuss React, and its related technologies, from a perspective that's useful for developers.  Please share blog posts, open-source projects, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow questions, and commentary related to React, React.js, React Native, or derivative technologies.  Let's make this a place where everyone can participate. So please avoid sharing content that is behind a paywall, like for-profit courses and workshops that require buying a ticket.  When in doubt about whether to share something, ask yourself:   ""Is this relevant to at least 50% of React Developers?""  For example, job descriptions target a small segment of React Developers based on experience and location. That segment is certainly smaller than 50% of all React Developers. So job descriptions should not be shared in this group.  Employers utilize ReactExpo.com/jobs to reach members of the group about their jobs.   Is your company hiring? Most of my business comes from referrals. And I'd be happy to send you a React t-shirt for showing your support!  Do you want to contribute to the group?   Not sure how?   One way you can help directly is by referring your employer to ReactExpo.com/jobs to post a job.   Are you looking for React courses, jobs, or templates?  Top React Courses for 2020: ReactExpo.com/top-react-courses  Top React Templates for 2020: ReactExpo.com/top-react-templates  One final question:  What do you need to grow in your career with React? https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6580235624102547457/  Thanks for joining, Brian Petro 386-237-8208 brian@angularjobs.com",INBOX

The main thing is basically eating meat and green vegetables.  Try to set yourself up for that by figuring out what you like and having that available.    Cold cuts, salami, cheese, etc are great for snacking.",INBOX

I was incredulous but just stuck with it, and it worked.    It takes about 2-3 weeks to really see the changes.  There is definitely some metabolic stuff happening in the early days and you just have to stick with it.  There's some low energy periods where your body hasn't really ramped up to ketosis yet and you feel pretty tired, just gotta power through that.  I also bought some keto testing strips from the drugstore, and monitored how deep into ketosis I was, which was mostly just interesting to me (didn't really affect the diet).

I actually read it twice, I sort of read it, got bogged down a bit in some of the drier science, went to Part 2, then came back and read it again.  A lot of the actual diet changes happened after I had sort of been thinking about the stuff in the book.  So then I started on it, can't really recall exactly how.  For me, the most important thing was making sure I have snacks that are on the diet.  What works for me is pickles, cheese, nuts, olives/feta mix from the safeway deli.

Here's the low down:  Program: A/A does 2 weeks of Ruby, 2 weeks of Rails, 2 weeks of JavaScript, 2 weeks of React, and 2 weeks of final projects, followed by 3 weeks of interview and jobhunt prep. The topics covered are pretty standard for the Rails+JS bootcamps, and their curriculum is constantly updated (it's collaboratively edited by the teachers via Github). Contrast with the other major bootcamp (Hack Reactor), which does a fully-JS stack. The difference is basically whether you want to work in JS or Ruby.  Admittance: They get a lot of applicants, but not all of them are good. The admittance rate is low (5%), consequently. They are looking for students they can count on to place, because they don't get paid if you don't! This means that the students that end up at a/A typically have some background in tech or development. They come from all over - we had a nuclear physics PhD, a cohort of UCLA students, and 2 high-school dropouts.  Admittance - Interviewing: There's a first round phone screen, which you should be prepared for if you've covered the fundamentals of programming (loops, conditionals, and variables). Then you'll have a coding challenge or another phone screen, and then you'll hear if you're accepted! This is followed by some prework (~10 hrs or so).  Post-graduation: there are 3 weeks of interview and jobhunt prep. This involves the lead instructor teaching you about common interview problems, algorithms, and data structures. The job hunt process is very structured - they have an idea of what your resume, cover letter, and GitHub should look like, and they have stats on how their process works. Basically your goal is to send out 200 applications, and (as of my cohort) for every 20 apps you send you get a phone screen, for every 2 phone screens you do you get an onsite, for every 2 onsites you do you get an offer. 200 apps roughly translates to 2-3 offers. Then they help you negotiate between them and get the highest offer you can. I think average starting salary in SF is $105k.   Some notes on applying to bootcamps (my personal opinion):  You should choose App Academy over DBC or Hack Reactor because of the job guarantee. As far as bootcamps go, in quality of curriculum and who I see getting placed in jobs, I see the rankings as: 1) Hack Reactor and App Academy; 2) Galvanize; 3) Dev Bootcamp/MakerSquare/whoever else has popped up recently, with Hackbright an outlier (women only). I'd recommend applying to at least Hack Reactor, App Academy, and Galvanize if you are serious about transitioning to development, and I'd be happy to refer you. That said, YMMV, and you should definitely meet people from each school and see how you like the vibe you get from them. You have experience in the tech industry so you should be able to tell what you are looking for.  Hope helpful and let me know if I can clarify anything,  Frank",INBOX

Fortunately, I have a phone interview with them tomorrow, and this will be the third call with them. but the first for this position.     Also, fortunately I have all of the documentation in my Evernote and Google Docs, there was a definitive reason why I put all of my documents in the cloud. ;-)    As far as CJ is concerned, I think it's low-class and unprofessional to ask others to remove recommendations for former employees. It's as if he is trying to erase the record of your contributions to the company by limiting your public profile.     Adult Swim has some seriously questionable business practices due to the fact that they are not on the main Turner campus and operate outside of the nexus of the industry. Eventually, those practices will prohibit growth.     So with Justin, I hope I didn't burn the bridge before I crossed it. I don't think so, but I'm just so concerned about work these days, and I really want that job.     Thanks again for all of your help. I miss working with you.

Sony didn't happen, because the guy who was supposed to be helping me get a job with them, I believe hindered my application.

I'm a bit nervous about the trip, but I'm just hoping that I make it out there without a problem.     What are you up to? Do you have any prospects? You were really smart to start applying for jobs last weekend. Solid foresight.     Let me know what's up.     Best wishes,   -J    ",INBOX

This year we are getting even more visionaries (TED-style speakers) to really get people to think innovatively.    Our events are not just about discovering the latest trends and strategies, they are highly focused on getting people to meet the right contacts to do deals. We will be running pre-scheduled one2one meetings, speed-networking, and other discussions as well as the usual drinks and parties.    I'd love to talk to you about our plans and get your input - let me know if you are free to do that.    You can look at http://www.globalMGF.com for more details.

I am very appreciative.     Justin, as Erik has mentioned, I recently moved out to San Mateo in July and have 5 years of experience at Turner Broadcasting in Content Production and Testing on multiple platforms including PC, Flash, Facebook, iOS and Android.    While working for Turner, I worked on several side projects to continue my career development. I co-founded the first gay gaming news site on the internet, GayGamer.net. And wrote for them for a year and a half with 3 articles a day for five days a week.     After my stint with GayGamer had come to pass, I co-founded the first gay gaming podcast-focused site as well, Gaymism.com. With Gaymism, we host 3 podcasts, all available in iTunes, and have been asked to speak at MIT Gambit Game Lab, and The Penny Arcade Expo in Seattle. This December we have also been asked to speak at BentCon, a gay comics and games expo.      I am very interested in leveraging my mobile experience and moving from primarily a testing role to that of a Content Manager. My turn at GameTap as an Associate Producer played to my organizational and communication strengths greatly, and I want to steer my career in that direction.      Considering my main roles at Turner and my various side projects that I have worked on through those years and up to this day, I would like to position myself as a Digital Producer with a core talent of testing and consideration to user experience.     Now I'm stepping into a completely different market as the Games industry is much larger on the West Coast.

One of our core focus areas is software engineering, where we’ve placed many fronted engineers like yourself. In software engineering, it can be challenging to take the next career step, because hiring processes are so opaque.

Specifically, they are looking for around 3 years of React/Redux, about the same with Javascript frameworks, as well as some Rails. These roles will be within their Consumer Value team and need to have web experience, not just mobile. There are a few other details, but those are the most important.   Fully remote, permanent, no contracts, full benefit package, 401K, performance bonuses, and they even offer relocation reimbursement if you decide you really want to be in Denver!  Let me know if you're interested and it will take us a 15-minute conversation that you can schedule at your convenience on my calendar. If you're not interested, no problem, just go ahead and decline the message. Looking forward to connecting soon!

Personally I would taylor it to the product design sign, you'll want to highlight for each project: Intro (problem, solution, thought process) Wire frames (sketches on paper is fine) Visual exploration , if any (optional) Final mocks Takeaways Key takeaways  I believe  design recruiters are looking not only for the imagery/visual elements; but mostly and mainly for the thought process you put into it. In essence, write! Each element on the portfolio should be a case study. The person reading it should see what problem you tried to solve via design, how you solved it (via design) and what he results were (cold hard numbers or if not available just key takeaways)  Look at this website (my wife's) www.carolapc.com The structure she has is good and got her interviews with FB, Uber, yelp and task rabbit within one week.

Wondering if you can help me out a bit with making inroads with LifeStreet on this.   Any advice you can share?  Quick Summary:   We provide an AI-driven, human assisted recruiting service which gets you qualified & vetted engineering, product, design & UX talent to help you scale your team, typically within 48 hours.   I will tell you more about what sets us apart below if you are interested.  Full details:  I work with Celential.ai. We've spent the last 2+ years building real AI, which has mapped 500K+ software engineers, product managers and designers in the Bay Area, Seattle and NYC.  Our solution is geared toward identifying passive candidates ready to join a new venture based on hundreds of signals gathered by our AI. These are passive candidates not likely found on recruiting platforms like Hired or Indeed.  We excel at hard-to-find skill-sets like Data & Machine Learning engineers, but we also have vetted candidates ready to interview for just about any software engineering, product, UX or design-focused role.  Historically, 75%+ of candidates we submit are chosen to interview (industry average is closer to 25%), so you can be confident that the candidates we vet & submit are a great fit for your position.  We built Celential.ai to be respectful of your time. We don't ask for a 20 minute call to qualify every job requirement and won't push you to go to lunch or become our best friend. All we need is your job description in any form and our AI, assisted by human experts, does the rest.   We can typically provide qualified & interested candidates for most positions in under 48 hours.  There is no upfront cost. Our fees are standard to the industry and you only pay if you hire one of our candidates.  We've attracted strong candidates for many other companies including large respected ones like Uber, Pivotal, Rally, Salesforce, Drive.ai and dozens of startups at all stages and industries.  The jobs posted on your website are right in our wheelhouse, so we could have a handful of solid candidates ready to interview this week or next.  If this sounds good, let me know your highest priority positions and we can get started. Or if you have additional questions, I am happy to jump on a call later this week or next.  Please reply here or email me at brian@celential.ai and let me know how you would like to proceed?  Thanks,  Brian Gupton Celential.ai 415.800.4392 brian@celential.ai",ARCHIVE

Your LinkedIn profile caught my attention as you mentioned you have done mobile automation with JavaScript. Would you be open to a brief chat sometime this week? Ideally, I'd like to discuss a QA Engineering position with a mobile gaming company, Playstudios.    Have you ever heard of Playstudios? If not, they’re the gaming studio behind one of the most popular casino apps in the world – MyVegas.    Founded by a team of casino and gaming industry veterans, Playstudios distinguished itself early by developing an unprecedented player loyalty program offering real-world rewards. Points are earned based on frequency and length of play, as well as participation in social actions, then redeemed for prizes ranging from free drinks to a chance to appear as a guest DJ in a hugely popular night club. (Yes, as in YOU, Jason Toups, are the on-stage DJ)    Today, MyVegas remains a massive success with over 1M daily active users and more than 18M downloads. Playstudios just closed a $20M round of funding, and is prepared to invest aggressively in furthering the already successful brand they've created, possibly on an international level.    The position offers highly competitive compensation, solid equity, unlimited PTO, and unparalleled health/dental benefits. (100% coverage for not only you, but any dependents as well)     If that sounds like something you'd be interested in being a part of, please feel free to suggest a time for us to chat this week. I'll make myself available at your earliest convenience, off-work hours are fine too.    Thank you in advance and have a wonderful week.    Pierce",ARCHIVE

Hi Anthony,     I just applied to the Sr. QA Engineer, Mobile Automation position listed on the Pandora careers page. Since moving to Lake Merritt area 2 years ago, I have been interested in applying to Pandora, but I have been waiting for some positions that would suit my existing skills and chosen career path.     At Kixeye, with James' guidance, we provided the company standard on mobile automation. Starting with our existing test suites, we noted which cases could be automated and committed our scripts to the main stable branch of the project. We ran our scripts in Monkeytalk and used Javascript to augment the recordings to suit our needs.     I would like to continue to work with mobile automation because of the speed, value and reliability it brings to the quality of a project.     If you would like to chat about this opportunity, please feel free to reach out to me anytime.     Cheers,  Jason Toups  404-625-6530    ",ARCHIVE

We did not have much time to work together, but when you mentioned that you were going to work for Lumosity I wondered how that environment would differ from the free to play game design model.  I have been working in QA for mobile games for years and would like to step out of the typical gaming structure for a while.     While Lumosity is at heart a collection of brain games, I really appreciate the motivation behind the design to make people sharper. I believe that we should never stop learning. The end of college doesn't mark the end of your education, it's the beginning of another journey in learning.     I am looking for a role that would help me further develop more hard skills, such as scripting automation and coding. For the past few months, I've been learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript on my own time. Although, I would like the opportunity to further develop my coding skills at work. While I have the most experience with Javascript at the moment, I could switch to Python or possibly Ruby if the occasion calls for it. If these are the type of skills that are challenged and developed in the QA Engineering role, than I am interested in applying for the position.     If this sounds like I would be a fit for this role, please let me know and I will apply.     Cheers!  -Jason    ",ARCHIVE

I am doing very well at Lumosity and I am happy to be here.   I am the hiring manager for the QA positions, and though we didn't work together for more than a week or so, if this feels like a company you would be interested in and you apply, you'll probably be screened by one of our recruiters, Rosa, who helps with hiring for the QA role. If that screen goes well the hiring / interview process is passed off to me.   The biggest advice I have is to get to know our product. (I noticed you spelled our company name incorrectly ;) lol) A big part of our hiring process is culture fit and interest, knowledge and passion for what we are building.

I believe a fresh New Casual game concept like this could easily rival the 'Poker.com' enterprises and you could also sell the Game online as well as having Live Tournament Play without the 'gambling' aspect.  This could also be a great Corporate PR asset; akin to how Microsoft offers their customers free online interactive computer games.  Who knows; if marketed properly, you could be looking at the Next Most Popular Casual Game Concept?     You're welcomed to play my NHL Card Hockey Demo from here: http://www.tegarttech.com/cardhockey/cardhockey_setup_B2.10_NHL08.exe for Windows only.  Enjoy and rest assured, the Game’s Programmer designed this Demo and set up the site so it is a Safe download.  You can also view Brian's profile on LinkedIn.     Target Market: i.e. Estimating there are at least 15 million Hockey fans in Canada and the US and charging only $10 per game; then with just 1% return, gross sales would be $1.5 million and that is a very low estimate.  Realistically, there are probably way more than 25 million Hockey fans in N. America alone and even the weakest marketing job should perhaps garner more than 1% return?  This is also convertible to a Soccer(Football) version and the World Football market is probably 50 to 100 times bigger than Hockey, perhaps more.  So the Numbers are there and the real potential for this Game is staggering once you factor in all the Card players and casual PC gamers in the world too.    I have an NHL Player to endorse the game and also welcome negotiation with Pro Soccer Players with regard to endorsement opportunities for the Football\Soccer version but would prefer a Player(s) investment and endorsement role.  For the Soccer version, you simply reduce the Scoring frequency, swap the Hockey Arena background for a Football Pitch, use Pro Football Player's names, Team Logos, make it Two Halves instead of 3 Periods, add features like Crowd Noise and everything else like that.  But the game-play is essentially the same and when a Goal is scored, instead of using the Horn audio effect, you could have a Voiceover that shouts the word: Gooooooooooooooal! or something equivalent.    Investment is all this venture needs because there is not that much development left to be done to the Game that is complicated or time consuming for a Professional Developer and so ideally I would prefer an Investor with sufficient resources to take over the project through to completing development, licensing if necessary and marketing the Game.  Which means the Investor/Partner will be expected to absorb those costs because we have done as much as are capable and can afford.  Of course, I will also assist with development if I may to share all the other design features for the game.  Let me know if there is anything else you need and I can also put anyone in touch with the game's Programmer for all ""technical"" queries.  Thanks for your consideration and look forward to discussing if you're interested or perhaps can refer me to someone else.  Naturally you would be compensated from proceeds should any of your referrals lead to a successful outcome.  Kind regards.

How are you! How are things at GameTap and how has the other stuff you've done for Adult Swim?    2. I'm about to finish a Little Big Planet so keep a look out. I'll message you when it's done. By the way, it's probably my game of the year! My level is a trip through all the planets of the Solar System. After that I'm doing a candy inspired level.    3. I was moving a bunch of games around and can't find my Lost Planet game. It's 360 but had the soundtrack and I don't know if I let you or Ryan or someone else at the office borrow. If it wasn't you or Ryan or don't think I could have loaned it to anyone else but it wouldn't hurt to ask in the test department because I'm notoriously friendly with my stuff.    Anyway take care and let me know how things are with you.    John",ARCHIVE
